    <h1>Delightful Desserts</h1>
    <h2>Mince Pies</h2>
      <p>Unlike the sweet fruity pie we all know and love today, sold by food retailers everywhere, mince pies werenâ€™t always as appetising as this. Originally containing actual meat, mince pies were consumed by those wealthy enough to afford such a luxury, consuming them in all shapes and sizes! Thought to be invented in the 13th century, the British used inspiration from Middle Eastern flavours to create what is now a Christmas delicacy known by everyone. </p>
    <h2>Christmas Pudding</h2>
    <h2>Yule Log</h2>
      <p>Inspired by a segment of an oak tree selected and burnt on Christmas Eve, the Yule Log eventually developed into a chocolate cake loved by all. Thought to bring luck to those who burnt it for 12 days and nights, this was a tradition in many European countries including France and Belgium. However, by 1945, its cake form had taken over its meaning.</p>
