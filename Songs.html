    <h1>Snowy Songs</h1>
    <h2>Jingle Bells</h2>
<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells
<p>Jingle all the way,</p>
<p>Oh what fun it is to ride</p>
<p>In a one-horse open sleigh,</p>
<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells</p>
<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells</p>
<p>Jingle all the way,</p>
<p>Oh what fun it is to ride</p>
<p>In a one-horse open sleigh.</p>

<p>Dashing through the snow</p>
<p>In a one-horse open sleigh</p>
<p>Through the fields we go</p>
<p>Laughing all the way.</p>
<p>Bells on bob-tail ring</p>
<p>Making spirits bright</p>
<p>Making spirits bright</p>
<p>What fun it is to ride and sing</p>
<p>A sleighing song tonight.</p>
<p>Repeat 3x</p>

<h2>Fairytale of New York</h2>
<p>It was Christmas Eve babe</p>
<p>In the drunk tank</p>
<p>An old man said to me, won't see another one</p>
<p>And then he sang a song</p>
<p>The Rare Old Mountain Dew</p>
<p>I turned my face away</p>
<p>And dreamed about you</p>
<p>Got on a lucky one</p>
<p>Came in eighteen to one</p>
<p>I've got a feeling</p>
<p>This year's for me and you</p>
<p>So happy Christmas</p>
<p>I love you baby</p>
<p>I can see a better time</p>
<p>When all our dreams come true</p>
<p>They've got cars big as bars</p>
<p>They've got rivers of gold</p>
<p>But the wind goes right through you</p>
<p>It's no place for the old</p>
<p>When you first took my hand</p>
<p>On a cold Christmas Eve</p>
<p>You promised me</p>
<p>Broadway was waiting for me</p>
<p>You were handsome</p>
<p>You were pretty</p>
<p>Queen of New York City</p>
<p>When the band finished playing</p>
<p>They howled out for more</p>
<p>Sinatra was swinging,</p>
<p>All the drunks they were singing</p>
<p>We kissed on a corner</p>
<p>Then danced through the night</p>
<p>The boys of the NYPD choir</p>
<p>Were singing "Galway Bay"</p>
<p>And the bells were ringing out</p>
<p>For Christmas day</p>
<p>You're a bum</p>
<p>You're a punk</p>
<p>You're an old slut on junk</p>
<p>Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed</p>
<p>You scumbag, you maggot</p>
<p>You cheap lousy faggot</p>
<p>Happy Christmas your arse</p>
<p>I pray God it's our last</p>
<p>The boys of the NYPD choir</p>
<p>Still singing "Galway Bay"</p>
<p>And the bells were ringing out</p>
<p>For Christmas day</p>
<p>I could have been someone</p>
<p>Well so could anyone</p>
<p>You took my dreams from me</p>
<p>When I first found you</p>
<p>I kept them with me babe</p>
<p>I put them with my own</p>
<p>Can't make it all alone</p>
<p>I've built my dreams around you</p>
<p>The boys of the NYPD choir</p>
<p>Still singing "Galway Bay"</p>
<p>And the bells are ringing out</p>
<p>For Christmas day</p>

<h2>Rockin' around the Christmas tree</h2>
<p>Rocking around the xmas tree:</p>
<p>At the Christmas party hop</p>
<p>Mistletoe hung where you can see</p>
<p>Every couple tries to stop</p>
<p>Rockin' around the Christmas tree</p>
<p>Let the Christmas spirit ring</p>
<p>Later we'll have some pumpkin pie</p>
<p>And we'll do some caroling</p>
<p>You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear</p>
<p>Voices singing, let's be jolly</p>
<p>Deck the halls with boughs of holly</p>
<p>Rockin' around the Christmas tree</p>
<p>Have a happy holiday</p>
<p>Everyone dancin' merrily</p>
<p>In the new old-fashioned way</p>
<p>You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear</p>
